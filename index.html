		<h2>Let’s revamp the logo</h2>
		<p>
			First, we started to refresh our logo. Not an easy task, that took way longer than expected! We tested so many directions: abstract, literal, mascot-like, childish, not childish, 3/4 perspective, front perspective, back perspective, on a road, without a road, in a red circle, without a red circle, etc… I genuinely think we might have built the biggest library of van icons in the history of van icons.
		</p>
		<h2>Building a new visual identity</h2>
		<p>
			In parallel to the logo rework, we needed to set new design pillars for our brand. We knew we wanted to create a brand system around the “tech journey”, which would nicely connect to the logo. So we started exploring different directions with the design agency.

		<h2>An abstract tech journey</h2>
		<p>
			We first started exploring an abstract representation of this tech journey: dotted lines to draw our students’ life path, map contour lines to represent the new territories they explore with us, pictures treated like train windows projecting students on their future tech career, etc…
